# Example expression: 10 + 5 * (2 ** 3) - 6 / 2

result = 10 + 5 * (2 ** 3) - 6 / 2

# Step 1: Evaluate the expression within the brackets first
#   2 ** 3 = 8
#   So, the expression becomes: 10 + 5 * 8 - 6 / 2

# Step 2: Perform Multiplication
#   5 * 8 = 40
#   So, the expression becomes: 10 + 40 - 6 / 2

# Step 3: Perform division
#   6 / 2 = 3
#   So, the expression becomes: 10 + 40 - 3

# Step 4: Perform addition
#   10 + 40 = 50
#   So, the final result is: 50 - 3 = 47

print(result)  # Output: 47.0
